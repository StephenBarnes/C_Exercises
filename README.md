# C programming exercises

## Rules

* Memory with size dependent on params in problem statement must be allocated
  dynamically. E.g. if the question asks for the 1234th Fibonacci number,
  I can't do `int fibs[1234]`.
* Assume input is legit, no sanitization/checks.

## Exercise sources

* [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/?location=algorithmic-heights)
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
* [Wikipedia list of data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)
* [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html)

Next things I want to try:

* Unrolled linked list
* Circular buffer
* Bignum library; squaring-based exponentiation
* Negamax
* Basic reimplementation of GNU `ping`
